unitedFlappy
============
unitedFlappy is a Unity-based 3d Flappy Bird clone intended for test-releases on the PC. We will also be experimenting with Android and IOs implementation. 

The code is done in C#, and can be freely adapted and used in any other game if needed, even by non-contributers of the project.

Right now, we only have the "Jumping Code" and one "pipe-set" to go through, wich is very barebones. This game is mainly a collaboration between two new developers, so we will be experimenting with some weird stuff. Stay tuned!
